#About Me
I'm deeply interested in the mathematical and computational boundaries of security and complexity. My focus lies on cryptography, especially post-quantum approaches (prime generation, elliptic curve cryptography, lattice-based systems), and on the quantum advantage in solving NP-Hard problems.
