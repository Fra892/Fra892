# 👋 About Me

I'm deeply interested in the mathematical and computational boundaries of security and complexity. My focus lies in **cryptography**, especially **post-quantum** approaches:
- 🔐 Prime generation  
- 🔐 Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)  
- 🔐 Lattice-based schemes (e.g. NTRU, Kyber)

I'm also exploring the potential **quantum advantage** in solving **NP-Hard problems**.  
On the less theoretical side, I'm interested in current and potential implementations of cryptographic protocols across internet layers—both at the **application** and **network/transport** levels.
